# ChoreQuest!

## App created for Parents by Parents to help them manage kids chores around house.


Parents set up the family with cool avatars, while kids become task conquerors. Parents, the superheroes, create chore lists with point values, turning responsibilities into a game. Kids choose tasks, earn points, and aim for rewards. Parental approval adds a checkpoint for rewards. Parents can spice things up by assigning tasks directly.

Did I mention prizes? Kids set goals, redeem points for awesome rewards—a win-win! Web socket connectivity keeps info up to date, and notifications add a touch of excitement. It's your family command center in your pocket! 🚀🏡💡
