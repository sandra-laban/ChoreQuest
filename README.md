# ChoreQuest!

## App created for Parents by Parents to help them manage kids chores around house.


I've got this awesome family management app to tell you about. Picture this: parents and kids working together in a fun way to tackle chores and earn rewards. It's like a virtual household adventure!

First off, parents get to set up their family and create cool avatars for everyone. Then, the whole crew joins in – other family members become part of the app, each assigned either the parent or child role. Parents are like the superheroes with admin powers, while the kids are the task conquerors.

Here's the fun part: parents can create a list of chores and rewards, each with its own point value. The kids get to choose which tasks they want to take on, mark them as done, and earn points. It's like turning everyday responsibilities into a game!

But wait, there's a twist! Before kids can claim their well-deserved rewards, parental approval is needed. It's like a built-in checkpoint to make sure everything's on track.

And just in case a chore seems a bit too dull, parents can step in and assign tasks directly – because sometimes, you need to spice things up a bit, right?

Oh, and did I mention the prizes? Kids can set goals for what they want, and once they've earned enough points, they can redeem them for awesome rewards. It's a win-win for everyone!

Plus, there's this cool web socket thing that keeps everyone's info up to date in real-time, and the app sends out notifications for special events. It's like having your own family command center right in your pocket. How cool is that?" 🚀🏡💡
